Previous 52°North Sensor web components used a shared datamodel that aimed to allow for interoperability of the existing components. It showed that while this is a very desirable feature, it incurs disproportionate amounts of complications as the data models defined by the standards differ heavily. To avoid such complications, the Connected Systems Implementation will not be interoperable with the other 52N SW-components. Data is stored as close to the standard-mandated form as possible, allowing for very straighforward mapping. Quart is used for handling all HTTP-based traffic.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments. Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips. From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture. Motivation Software does not run without hardware.
